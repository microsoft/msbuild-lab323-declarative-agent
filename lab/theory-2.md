# What is TypeSpec? 

**TypeSpec** is a language developed by Microsoft for designing and describing API contracts in a structured and type-safe way. Think of it like a blueprint for how your agent/ API should look and behave including instructions, what data it accepts, returns, and how different parts of the agent and its actions are connected.


## Why TypeScript?

If you like how TypeScript enforces structure in your frontend/backend code, you'll love how TypeSpec enforces structure in your agent and API surface. It fits perfectly in design-first development workflows that align with tools Visual Studio Code.

**Clear Communication** - It provides a single source of truth that defines how APIs should behave, avoiding confusion when dealing with multiple manifest files like in the case of declarative agents.

**Consistency** - By using TypeSpec, you ensure all parts of your agent and its actions, capabilities are designed consistently — naming, types, and endpoints all follow the same pattern.

**Automation Friendly** - TypeSpec can automatically generate OpenAPI specs and other manifests saving time and reducing human errors.

**Early Validation** - Catch design issues early before writing actual code for example, mismatched data types or unclear API routes.

**Design-First Approach** - Encourages thinking about agent and API structure and contracts before jumping into implementation, leading to better long-term maintainability.
