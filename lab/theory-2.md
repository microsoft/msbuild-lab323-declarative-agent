# What is TypeSpec? 

**TypeSpec** is a language developed by Microsoft for designing and describing API contracts in a structured and type-safe way. Think of it like a blueprint for how an API should look and behave including what data it accepts, returns, and how different parts of the agent and its actions are connected.


## Why TypeSpec for Agents?

If you like how TypeScript enforces structure in your frontend/backend code, you'll love how TypeSpec enforces structure in your agent and its API services like actions. It fits perfectly in design-first development workflows that align with tools like Visual Studio Code.

- **Clear Communication** - It provides a single source of truth that defines how your agent should behave, avoiding confusion when dealing with multiple manifest files like in the case of Declarative Agents.

- **Consistency** - It ensure all parts of your agent and its actions, capabilities etc are designed consistently following the same pattern.

- **Automation Friendly** - It can automatically generate OpenAPI specs and other manifests saving time and reducing human errors.

- **Early Validation** - It catches design issues early before writing actual code for example, mismatched data types or unclear definintions.

- **Design-First Approach** - It encourages thinking about agent and API structure and contracts before jumping into implementation, leading to better long-term maintainability.
